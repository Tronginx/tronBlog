What happens when you beg: You decrease your value: If you’re really that great, why don’t you have a significant other yet? Respect cannot be generated, and therefore neither can feelings. You are seen as a tool. Even if a relationship is established with difficulty due to an imbalance in the relationship, it will quickly break down. So what should we do in interpersonal relationships? Build a personal brand. Building a personal brand is essential for making friends, socializing, and even career development.\nLet’s try a thought experiment: How would your friends introduce you to others? No one will like this kind of comment: “XXX is a good person.” Because it represents that your value is too low.\nWhen you think of Apple, what comes to mind? A powerful software and hardware ecosystem, simple and easy-to-use software. And when you think of TikTok, what comes to mind? Wasting countless hours and attention. What about 360 Security or Kwai?\nThe question is: What is your brand value? What is the most easily recognizable trait about you to outsiders?\nSo how can you promote your personal brand?\nFind your brand value Your current brand value: How would others introduce me to their friends in one sentence? No one will like this kind of comment: “XXX is a good person.” Because it represents that your value is too low. Continuous effort to build a strong brand value Start thinking today and start doing today: How to turn yourself into a boutique rather than a commodity. Let people around you know about your dreams and beliefs, and actually work on promoting them. People who are attracted may become: customers, friends, students, teachers. This type of relationship is much closer than those pursued. Things you can do: update a blog every week, record what you’re doing, and participate in clubs with shared interests. Create interpersonal links “like fishing.” When you feel the tension, let the line out. Although the distance is far, the fishing line is still there. When the fish gets tired, it will swim towards you. If you keep pulling towards yourself, the fishing line will break, and the fish will run away. Birds of a feather flock together, and people like to be around those who are like themselves. You must project your interests to the people around you, and let everyone know about your actions and beliefs. Try doing things that you admire others doing and find the joy in them.
