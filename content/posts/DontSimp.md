不要追求：
- 追会怎么样： 对方会觉得你意图太强烈，从而被吓跑
- 求会怎么样：
	- 降低你的价值：如果你真的这么好，为什么这么久都没有男/女朋友
	- 无法产生尊重，自然无法产生感情
	- 把你当做工具人
- 如果双方关系是不平衡的，即使勉强建立的关系，也会很快破裂

人际关系中，我们应该怎么做呢？树立个人品牌
树立个人品牌对于交友，社交，甚至是职业发展都是很重要的。

做一个思想实验: 你的朋友会怎么和别人来介绍你呢？
大家都不会喜欢这样的评价：“xxx是一个好人” 
因为这代表你的价值太低

试着想到苹果公司你会想到什么？软件硬件生态的强大，简单好用的软件
而想到抖音你会想到什么？浪费无数的时间和注意力
再比如360杀毒，快手？

这个问题问的是：你的品牌价值是什么？你身上最容易被外人看到的特质是什么？

那么如何营务自己的个人品牌呢？
- 找到自己的品牌价值
	- 你目前的品牌价值：别人会怎么用一句话来把我介绍给其他朋友
		- 大家都不会喜欢这样的评价：“xxx是一个好人” 因为这代表你的价值太低
- 持续的努力来建立一个强而有力的品牌价值
	- 今天开始就思索，今天就开始做：怎么把自己经营成一个精品，而不是一个可替代品
	- 让周围的人知道，自己的梦想和信念，并且切实地在营务这件事
		- 吸引来的人可能会变成：客户，朋友，学生，老师
		- 这样构成的关系比你追求来的要紧密的多
		- 可以做的事：每周更新一个blog， 记录自己正在做的事情，参加由共同爱好的club
	- 创造人际链接"就像钓鱼" 
		-  感到拉力的时候要放线，虽然距离远了，但鱼线还在，等鱼游累了会往你的方向游
		- 如果感到一味地向自己的方向用力，鱼线会断，鱼会跑
- 物以类聚，人都会喜欢和自己相同的人
	- 一定要向身边的人散发自己的爱好，让大家知道你的行动和理念
	- 尝试着做自己欣赏的人做的事情，体验其中乐趣的点在哪里



Don't simp:
- What happens when you pursue someone:
    - The other person may feel that your intentions are too strong, which can scare them away.
- What happens when you beg:
    - You decrease your value: If you're really that great, why don't you have a significant other yet?
    - Respect cannot be generated, and therefore neither can feelings.
    - You are seen as a tool.
- Even if a relationship is established with difficulty due to an imbalance in the relationship, it will quickly break down.

So what should we do in interpersonal relationships? Build a personal brand. Building a personal brand is essential for making friends, socializing, and even career development.

Let's try a thought experiment: How would your friends introduce you to others? No one will like this kind of comment: "XXX is a good person." Because it represents that your value is too low.

When you think of Apple, what comes to mind? A powerful software and hardware ecosystem, simple and easy-to-use software. And when you think of TikTok, what comes to mind? Wasting countless hours and attention. What about 360 Security or Kwai?

The question is: What is your brand value? What is the most easily recognizable trait about you to outsiders?

So how can you promote your personal brand?

- Find your brand value
    - Your current brand value: How would others introduce me to their friends in one sentence?
        - No one will like this kind of comment: "XXX is a good person." Because it represents that your value is too low.
- Continuous effort to build a strong brand value
    - Start thinking today and start doing today: How to turn yourself into a boutique rather than a commodity.
    - Let people around you know about your dreams and beliefs, and actually work on promoting them.
        - People who are attracted may become: customers, friends, students, teachers.
        - This type of relationship is much closer than those pursued.
        - Things you can do: update a blog every week, record what you're doing, and participate in clubs with shared interests.
    - Create interpersonal links "like fishing."
        - When you feel the tension, let the line out. Although the distance is far, the fishing line is still there. When the fish gets tired, it will swim towards you.
        - If you keep pulling towards yourself, the fishing line will break, and the fish will run away.
- Birds of a feather flock together, and people like to be around those who are like themselves.
    - You must project your interests to the people around you, and let everyone know about your actions and beliefs.
    - Try doing things that you admire others doing and find the joy in them.
