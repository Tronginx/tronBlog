Don't simp:
- What happens when you simp someone:
    - The other person may feel that your intentions are too strong, which can scare them away.
- What happens when you beg:
    - You decrease your value: If you're really that great, why don't you have a significant other yet?
    - Respect cannot be generated, and therefore neither can feelings.
    - You are seen as a tool.
- Even if a relationship is established with difficulty due to an imbalance in the relationship, it will quickly break down.

So what should we do in interpersonal relationships? Build a personal brand. Building a personal brand is essential for making friends, socializing, and even career development.

Let's try a thought experiment: How would your friends introduce you to others? No one will like this kind of comment: "XXX is a good person." Because it represents that your value is too low.

When you think of Apple, what comes to mind? A powerful software and hardware ecosystem, simple and easy-to-use software. And when you think of TikTok, what comes to mind? Wasting countless hours and attention. What about 360 Security or Kwai?

The question is: What is your brand value? What is the most easily recognizable trait about you to outsiders?

So how can you promote your personal brand?

- Find your brand value
    - Your current brand value: How would others introduce me to their friends in one sentence?
        - No one will like this kind of comment: "XXX is a good person." Because it represents that your value is too low.
- Continuous effort to build a strong brand value
    - Start thinking today and start doing today: How to turn yourself into a boutique rather than a commodity.
    - Let people around you know about your dreams and beliefs, and actually work on promoting them.
        - People who are attracted may become: customers, friends, students, teachers.
        - This type of relationship is much closer than those pursued.
        - Things you can do: update a blog every week, record what you're doing, and participate in clubs with shared interests.
    - Create interpersonal links "like fishing."
        - When you feel the tension, let the line out. Although the distance is far, the fishing line is still there. When the fish gets tired, it will swim towards you.
        - If you keep pulling towards yourself, the fishing line will break, and the fish will run away.
- Birds of a feather flock together, and people like to be around those who are like themselves.
    - You must project your interests to the people around you, and let everyone know about your actions and beliefs.
    - Try doing things that you admire others doing and find the joy in them.
